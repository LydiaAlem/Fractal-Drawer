# Fractal Project!
        
     This project was completed as part of an Algorithms and Data Structures course. The objective was to create 
     a Java program that utilizes a visual "canvas" to display fractal triangles, circles, and rectangles. The 
     "Canvas" class extends the Applet class, which is a built-in Java class for creating applets, or small 
     programs that run in a web browser. The Applet class was used to create the Frame object, which serves as 
     the top-level window for the program and provides a title bar and other standard window features. The program 
     uses a combination of recursive algorithms and graphics libraries to generate and render the fractal shapes
     on the canvas.

## Getting Started
                
### Prerequisites [(Click here!)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)
    >> Install Java 8 or higher
        
### Installing
##### 1) Clone the directory
      git clone https://github.com/LydiaAlem/Fractal-Drawer.git
           
         
##### 2) Navigate to the project directory:
      >> cd Fractal-Drawer
        
##### 3) Compile the source code:
      >> javac FractalDrawer.java
                
##### 4) Run the program
      >> java FractalDrawer
